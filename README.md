# GifTastic

In this application, the user can click on any of the prepopulated buttons that will provide the top 10 gif's from the Giphy API.

In addition, there is the ability to add a button to the list by typing what you would like into the input field. Once it is submitted, a new button will be added that can be clicked to add more gif's.

The gif's will be appended to the site in a static state. Once you click on the image, it will begin to move. To pause it, you can click on it once more.
